# Description
RevInfo automatically creates Git commit data and Automation Studio build information in a variable declaration file which you can use within an Automation Studio project. It makes clear what committed version of code is running and who transferred it (+when!) to ensure youâ€™ll never walk away from a machine with uncommited code, ever again.

For more documentation and examples, see https://loupeteam.github.io/LoupeDocs/tools/revinfo.html

**Configuration Pre-Build Step:**
```
"$(AS_PROJECT_PATH)\Logical\Infrastructure\RevInfo\getRevInfo.sh"
```

# Installation
To install using the Loupe Package Manager (LPM), in an initialized Automation Studio project directory run `lpm install revinfopkg`. For more information about LPM, see https://loupeteam.github.io/LoupeDocs/tools/lpm.html
